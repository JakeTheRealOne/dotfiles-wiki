## Features:
- Microphone ping: Small dot in the top bar, indicates if there is apps using the microphone. No more privacy problems !

- Quick access to power menu: Hovering the home button shows 3 power options (shutdown, reboot and sleep). It's faster and better for people like us that reboot their machine every 2 minutes.

- Battery center: (for laptop users) the battery center let you access vitals and stats about the battery and change power mode and cpu frequency:

- CPU frequency cap: Why do we like linux ? Because it lets us have full access on our hardware. On the same idea, there is a scale in the battery center that allows the user to choose the maximum CPU frequency, without breaking the hardware bounds. The easiest way to reduce power rate on laptops with low battery capacity:
